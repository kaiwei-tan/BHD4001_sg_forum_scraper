## Final Year Project / Honors Dissertation (BHD4001)
<b><i>Singaporean Forum Scraper</i></b>

Part of my Honors Dissertation dealing with Singlish (Singaporean colloquial English).
This code is used to scrape two Singaporean local forums (where Singaporeans communicate with one another informally and predominantly in Singlish) for relevant text data which would subsequently be used for analysis and text modelling in the project.

Supervised by: Professor Yuan Xue-Ming
